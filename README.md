# CIS160-MP6
Practice interacting with strings and files in C.

This program was intended to read in a file and echo it to the screen. After that, the program is intended to edit the fileâ€™s contents and save the new content in another file (MP6Output.dat). Finally, the program reports the number of letters, upper case letters, lower case letters, numbers, spaces, and punctuation parks both before and after the edits.
